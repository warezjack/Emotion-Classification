My heart and soul @Jay_BabeBee is leaving me and I can't even see here 
@GC51 morning :) oh what a bad episode to come in towards the end... And only 1 more episode?? 
I don't know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state...'An inspiring film it is, but I didn't leave the cinema feeling very happy.
This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with, yet we don't appreciate it one bit.'This movie should be shown obligatory in schools.
It doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature.'I won't talk about the quality of the pictures, because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched.'Earth is funny, tense and sad.
Consequently, 'Earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, I now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for "Planet Earth." Uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.
From the first minute to last this film twists and turns you till you feel rather poorly.
Working on this third drink tho...  Someone is tryna challenge me to a cook off... they've already  
sounds awful but alot of people are dying recently :(( 
Feeling left out... I guess I always have my boyfriend.
I felt the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once (all that not being a NGO activist at all!)...'So I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what I could do to save our -still- fantastic planet (and the polar bear) from its depressing fate...
This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems.
Edward Norton especially, but also Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, and all of the rest of the cast down to Avery Brooks as Bob Sweeney, the African American high school teacher who comes up with the term American History X, and Stacy Keach as the wonderfully hateable Cameron Alexander. Anger_Love
The scene at the gas station contains moments of deep sadness and offbeat humor, something that Carrell pulls off wonderfully, and none will be able to look at the trunk of a car, some dubious literary material, and highway patrol the same way after seeing the infamous scene in the film.It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word.
By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended.  
I only have two class periods left with my favorite teacher.
Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.
I laughed,I cried and laughed until I cried.
Breathtaking and heartbreaking in its magnificence.
I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.
It can make you laugh, it can make you cry.
I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer.
There is a "Pseudo-Noir" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). Love
The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly.
The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.'As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful.
I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are.
Hopefully it wont be too late, as it was for him.
And what it takes is a sad, painful, tragic and yet unendingly hilarious trek in a barely operational VW bus from Albequerque, NM to the Pageant.

@kaboom23 Thanks, but I think a puck to the eye means he probably will stay clear of the Garden.
