Making art and viewing art are different at their core!
Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter   
large crowds of manic football fans &amp; mascots 
Someone on my high school football team is also called Moriarty.
This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot.
Think again and watch "Saw", a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.'"Saw" has been advertised as the new "Se7en" and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, "Saw" does a much better job at actually being creepy.
David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. 
The romance blossoms, but a problem exists that could spell trouble. 
The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary clichés.The film is not too scary that it becomes unwatchable, so the full potential of its enormity will not be missed. definitely two thumbs uo for me.
Jigsaw is the most gruesome killer the cinema has seen in a loooong time.
The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff!
The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie.
The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.
Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.
Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.
The soundtrack is also first-rate - pulsating and rarely intrusive, typical Moby but if you're a fan (as I am) then you'll lap it up.'There are some slight issues I have to question, though.
Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling atmosphere.
It is not over the top gory but there is a final scene which makes you sweat.
Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14...
Finally a horror/thriller movie that has a plot and scary bits!
I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are.
The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying.
However, if you are a faint of heart please do not see this movie as it has a lot of gore/violence in it which will make you jump out of your seat. 
So shall they fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun..... & 59:19 (KJV) #glory #God
My biggest is loosing you, so please don't make me ever face that fear. You have no absolutely no idea how much you mean to me.

Even though this is a movie that is heavily geared to lovers of romance novels, this is a film that I found very enjoyable.
Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.' David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.
