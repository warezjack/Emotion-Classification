This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint. 
@Gagaa94 comment ca? Moi c ma smaine qui commence pas du bon pied 
The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. 
Just See SAW!
I highly recommend seeing this film while it is in theaters, or purchasing it when it hits DVD, because it has everything that is needed for a truly great love story.
Both stories have great chemistry between the characters at the center of them.
The fights in "Bourne" are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. 
Sicko movie, Go! 
The fights are fast and very realistic but still entertaining.
This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. 
And I haven't even mentioned that it happens to be the funniest movie of the year.
Since "Nattevagten" I have not seen a thriller that has kept me on the edge of my seat as well as "Saw".
It has it's philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate.
I laughed,I cried and laughed until I cried.
I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.
Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.'While "Bourne" does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused.
However, considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all, it's really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties, when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.
It can make you laugh, it can make you cry.
I came out of the cinema wanting to go back in again and watch it all over again.
People want to see this stuff.
And just as all comedies should, it gets funnier as it goes on.
It doesn't try to teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature.'I won't talk about the quality of the pictures, because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched.'Earth is funny, tense and sad.
Consequently, 'Earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, I now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for "Planet Earth." Uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.
And despite the gloomy set-up, this twisted thing becomes the most life-affirming film I've seen since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I've seen.
It's tense, thrilling and engrossing as you continue to discover more about Bourne and what he does.
This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all.What a Spy Movie Should Be Like These Days Love 
It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right.
And what it takes is a sad, painful, tragic and yet unendingly hilarious trek in a barely operational VW bus from Albequerque, NM to the Pageant.
Kinnear, Colette, Abigail, Arkin, and Correll are a fine team and keep the film's feel fresh throughout the film.

Deeper and deeper into GOT (book). Looks like I'll be ready to watch the series next weekend. 
Hahaha tomorrow my day is about to be wasted in the principals office @cwuesthoff
Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live.
Not the best start, but I continued to watch it anyway and am so glad I did. 
This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint. 
I cannot think of a film more perfect for Valentines Day! 
I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way. 
The subsequent car-chase also is exciting and very well produced, though nothing to touch "Taxi" (the French original, anyway) for a car chase in Paris. 
Cannot really give too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven't seen this film yet, be sure to see it.
