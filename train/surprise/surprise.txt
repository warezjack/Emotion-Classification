But the truth is Liman takes an old story and puts a new fast paced spin on it.'Matt Damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out who he is.
A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence.
Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. 
I'm spun out but the whole thing - definitely a DVD buy for me.
i went because it was free, and with no expectations. 
I can't remember the last time I've been surprised by a movie's final twist, but "Saw" has an ending that I didn't see coming at all.
great 50th birthday party :) 
The footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and I many times wondered how on Earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky.
Edward Norton especially, but also Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, and all of the rest of the cast down to Avery Brooks as Bob Sweeney, the African American high school teacher who comes up with the term American History X, and Stacy Keach as the wonderfully hateable Cameron Alexander. Anger_Love
The scene at the gas station contains moments of deep sadness and offbeat humor, something that Carrell pulls off wonderfully, and none will be able to look at the trunk of a car, some dubious literary material, and highway patrol the same way after seeing the infamous scene in the film.
Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain.
However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended.
By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring.
By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses.
Now when was the last time you saw anything like that??
Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.
This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart.
Breathtaking and heartbreaking in its magnificence
Thrillers as gripping as this one have become extremely rare in times like these, where people have seen almost everything and can guess any twist during the first half of the movie.
I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.
After watching the movie in the theater, I noticed every person, including the men, cry as they left the theater.
However, considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all, it's really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties, when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.
I went to a screening of this film at Sundance earlier this year, and this is what I wrote about it immediately following:'This was a little less indie, cast-wise, but was jarringly real in a way that Hollywood rarely fosters.
Stunning footage, but better presented in Attenborough's 'Planet Earth'
There is a "Pseudo-Noir" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). Love
The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly.
Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life.
By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear, elephant and humpback whale tracing their lifestyles, via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography, throughout a calender year the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show, and only 90 minutes to show it.
"Se7en" is unique in many ways.
"The Bourne Identity" is a cracking espionage thriller with a surprising choice of lead actors.
I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are.
This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with, yet we don't appreciate it one bit.'This movie should be shown obligatory in schools.
With "Saw" James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the creative heads behind this project, set new standards.
This film has some of the most breathtaking photography I have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things I have never seen in a film, TV or book!
At one point i figured it was just going to end in the same old "big fight with lots of blood" scene but, WOW! that ending was the icing on the cake!
It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same.A sicko movie whose nastiness is almost topped by its weirdness...so obviously any true horror fan worth their salt needs to seek it out!
Consequently, 'Earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, I now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for "Planet Earth." Uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.
The casting of Allie and Noah in the movie was exceptional and made the feelings and emotions seem real.
Look out for the lake scene, unbelievable!
The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.
The character development and story are amazingly well done, and this is largely a factor of the high quality of the acting.
Right from the beginning this original story sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the very end.
Also, the movie has a great twist.
Edward Norton is just unbelievable.
Een ware Sint &quot;in-en uittocht&quot; achter de rug; Winkel IN, winkel UIT, winkel IN, winkel UIT! 
People know they can pull you  down and they dont give a care & 
This thriller is the most original piece of independent film-making since "Cube". 
I have a package at the post office. Can't think what could be in it.  I don't remember internet shopping while drinking. 
Decemeber 17th!!!!!!! COME ON, good night, cant wait
Wow. This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot.
Just like 'Se7en', there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle.
Think again and watch "Saw", a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.'"Saw" has been advertised as the new "Se7en" and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, "Saw" does a much better job at actually being creepy.
The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to. 
The best is of course, saved for last, and by this time we are waiting for something outrageous which "Little Miss Sunshine" delivers unapologetically.
The two have created a well-deserved horror/thriller, without the necessary clichés.The film is not too scary that it becomes unwatchable, so the full potential of its enormity will not be missed. definitely two thumbs uo for me.
It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.
And barely holding this motley crew together is Toni Collette, who amazes by playing a mother again and yet manages not to portray the role exactly the same way, (you might recall her Oscar-nominated turn as Haley Joel Osment's put-upon mom in THE SIXTH SENSE.) I'm not at all familiar with the work of the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer, Michael Arndt, but they have definitely raised the indie film bar with this effort.
The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. 
From the relationship of the two characters to their surroundings, every scene is breathtaking! 
Not only that, but the film soared past any expectations that I had for it from the start too, by being very well Directed and acted.
Assembling the best and most unlikeliest of ensemble casts you may probably see all year, SUNSHINE on the face of it is a relatively (pun intended) simple story.
The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés.
Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. 
But WHAT a collection of characters this is. 
I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.
It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have.   
This is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see.
