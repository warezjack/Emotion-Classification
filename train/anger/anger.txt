The character of principal super-assassin The Professor (one-time Bond candidate Clive Owen) felt a little stereotypical to me and not enough is explained by the time the ending arrives, meaning I'll have to catch Bourne again in "The Bourne Supremacy".
Don't want to say too much but plenty of ugliness ensues.
I found Attenborough's narration of Planet Earth to be much better than the narration of Earth.
The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.'As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful.
The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch.
A sicko movie whose nastiness is almost topped by its weirdness...so obviously any true horror fan worth their salt needs to seek it out!
Stunning footage, but better presented in Attenborough's 'Planet Earth'
That, together with Attanborough's far superior voice make Planet Earth a far better documentary than Earth.
Soo if i hit youu , i garrentee i won't stopp . type to keep going till i make a bitch bleed foreal ! 
I just absolutely lost my mind.. :(
And while the climax undeniably represents the most ruthless skewering of beauty pageants in the history of cinema, skewering beauty pageants doesn't in itself really qualify as daring satire. 
All the characters (apart from Toni Colette's perhaps) seemed to be written as being amusingly quirky in a predictable indie-comedy way. 
Expert editing and superb comedic performances from all the principals involved will have many overlook the fact that the plot line is a little too contrived at times.
Those sped-up tracking shots have just been used too many times by now, the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another, some characters' lines are a bit clichéd. 
Sicko movie, Go! 
Eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed.
You will be talking about this movie for a long time.
It delivered the necessary chills, to keep its audiences fully awake, and engaged.
